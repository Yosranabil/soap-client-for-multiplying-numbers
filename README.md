# soap-client-for-multiplying-numbers

This project code is a simple SOAP client that uses the Axios and xml2js libraries to multiply two numbers. The user enters two numbers on the command line and the code sends a SOAP request to a web service to multiply the numbers. The web service returns the multiplication result in XML format and the code parses the XML response to get the multiplication result.

The code is written in JavaScript and is very easy to understand. It is a good example of how to use the Axios and xml2js libraries to make SOAP requests and parse XML responses.

Here are some of the key features of the project code:

* Uses the Axios and xml2js libraries
* Makes a SOAP request to a web service to multiply two numbers
* Parses the XML response to get the multiplication result
* Easy to understand and modify
